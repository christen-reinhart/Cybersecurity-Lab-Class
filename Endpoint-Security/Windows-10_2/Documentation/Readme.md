# CIS Windows 10 Enterprise v3.0.0 - PowerShell Hardening Scripts

## Overview

This documentation supports the **PowerShell scripts provided in the `/Scripts` folder**, which automate key hardening steps as per **CIS Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise Benchmark v3.0.0**.

These scripts implement **recommended settings for standalone systems** and can also serve as a reference for **enterprise environments with local policy configuration**.

## üìÇ Scripts Directory

All scripts are located at:

```
Cybersecurity-Lab-Class/Endpoint-Security/Windows-10_2/Scripts
```

Each script is named to reflect its corresponding CIS Benchmark section for easy reference and modular execution.

## ‚úî Script Execution Example

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator**.
2. Navigate to the script directory:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Path\To\Scripts"
   ```
3. Run the desired script:
   ```powershell
   .\1.1.1-EnforcePasswordHistory.ps1
   ```

## üìù Logging and Auditability

- All scripts **start a transcript** automatically and log output to:
  ```
  C:\CIS-Hardening-Logs\
  ```
- **Admin check** is enforced at the start of every script.
- **secedit** is used where applicable for secure application of settings.
- Log files are timestamped and named per CIS control (example: `1.1.1-EnforcePasswordHistory.log`).

## üóÇ Script Summary

(Summary table omitted for brevity ‚Äî same as previously shown)

## ‚ö† Important Notes

- Scripts target **local machine policies only**.
- In **Active Directory environments**, these settings must be applied via **GPO** at the **Domain Controllers level** for user accounts or using **Password Settings Objects (PSOs)**.
- Test scripts on **non-production systems** first.
